## What it does:

This tool synchronizes
[CloudPassage Halo issues](https://blog.cloudpassage.com/2017/05/30/issues-and-policies-with-halo/)
with Jira issues.

New issues discovered in Halo cause new issues to be created in Jira.

Updated issues in Halo will cause comments to be created in the corresponding
Jira issue, containing information from the updated issue.

Closed issues in Halo will cause the corresponding Jira issue to be closed.

Issues which have been prematurely closed will be re-opened if the Halo issue
still exists, and issues which are re-opened will cause the corresponding Jira
issue to re-open.

Version 1 of this integration will only support issues associated with the
CloudPassage Halo ServerSecure module (FIM, CSM, SVM, LIDS). Future versions
may support ContainerSecure- and CloudSecure-related issues.

## How it works

This integration is delivered as Python tool, enclosed in a Docker container
image. Sure, you can run the enclosed tool by itself... but running it outside
the container image is not supported.

The container is run periodically, and retrieves the status of all issues which
have been opened, closed, or updated since the last time the tool was run. The
tool then synchronizes Halo issue status with the status of the corresponding
Jira issues.

### Issue created

When an issue is created, the integration will search for an existing issue in
Jira by Halo issue ID. If a issue already exists with the issue ID, the
operation will be treated as an `Issue updated` action. If no issue exists with
the Halo issue ID, the integration will create the issue in Jira according to
the field mappings defined in the runtime configuration, and having the status
defined by ${NEW_ISSUE_STATUS} (see below).

### Issue updated

When a Halo issue is updated, the integration will search for the original
issue in Jira. If no issue can be found in Jira for the associated Halo issue
ID, this will be treated as an `Issue created` action. If a Jira issue is found
for the updated issue, the integration will add a comment to the Jira issue
containing the latest findings. These updates may happen as frequently as your
configured scan interval.

### Issue resolved

When a Halo issue is resolved, the integration searches Jira for the
corresponding issue, adds a comment to the issue with resolution information,
and triggers the ${ISSUE_CLOSE_TRANSITION} in Jira (see below). If no Jira
issue can be found with a corresponding Halo issue ID, this will be treated as
an `Issue created`, then an `Issue resolved` event. This will effectively create
and close a issue for tracking purposes in Jira.

### Issue reopened

When a Halo issue is re-opened, the integration searches for the closed Jira
issue with the corresponding Halo issue ID. If none can be found, this is
treated as an `Issue created` event. If the original issue can be located, an
${ISSUE_REOPEN_TRANSITION} (see below) is triggered and a comment is added
to the Jira issue containing information about why the issue was re-opened.
If the issue has a status which matches one in ${HARD_CLOSED_STATUS}, a new
issue will be opened.



## Requirements

* CloudPassage Halo API key (with auditor permissions)
* Jira Cloud API token (see __Jira permissions__, below)
* Scheduling system
  * Recommended: [CloudPassage Cortex](https://github.com/cloudpassage/cortex)
  * If you're not using Cortex, you need a task scheduler and a Docker engine
  to run the container.
* Optional: Run in AWS Lambda!  See [LAMBDA.md](LAMBDA.md)

## Running (stand-alone)

1. Obtain Jira and CloudPassage Halo API credentials
1. Set environment variables (see __Environment variables__, below.)
1. Run the container:
```
docker run \
    -it \
    --rm \
    --read-only \
    -e ENV_VAR:${ENV_VAR} \ # one of these for every environment variable
    docker.io/halotools/jira_halo_issues_sync:latest
```

## Notes

### Workflow considerations

In order to route Jira issues to the appropriate people, we expect that a
Jira workflow will perform the routing based on the Jira issue's contents, upon
the creation of the issue in Jira.

This integration will create all Jira issues in the same Jira project, and the
implementer will use Jira workflows together with issue attributes (like
`asset_group_path`, detailed below) to route issues to other projects or
to assign issues to specific Jira users.

The process whereby this integration updates or closes Jira issues does not
search for issues within a specific project. It expects a searchable field to
exist which contains the Halo issue ID, and as long as the issue exists
somewhere in Jira (in any project), the integration will attempt to update the
Jira issue. This is also the process by which the integration prevents the
creation of duplicate issues for the same issue.

In large environments with many Halo issues, this integration can produce a
great number of issues in Jira. Consider creating workflows in Jira to group
issues into epics, or create relevant dashboards which group issues based on
group paths, issue type, or some other commonality relevant for the person
tasked with resolving vulnerabilities.

### Jira permissions

Requirements TBD

### Jira field mapping

Mapping Halo issues to Jira fields can be accomplished by setting and passing
the ${JIRA_FIELD_MAPPING} into the container. This field should be formatted
like this: `halo_field_1:jira_field_1;halo_field_2:jira_field_2`. Similarly,
the ${JIRA_FIELD_STATIC} mapping separates keys from values with a colon (:)
and separates key/value pairs with a semicolon (;).

Available Halo fields are:
