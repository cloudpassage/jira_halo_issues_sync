Separate filesystem partitions may prevent successful resizing, or may require the installation of additional tools solely for the purpose of resizing operations. The use of these additional tools may introduce their own security considerations.\\n\\nCIS Critical Controls:\\nTitle: Ensure Audit Logging Systems Are Not Subject To Loss (i.e. rotation/archive) \\nControl number: 6.3 \\n\\nAJ Lewis, \\LVM HOWTO\\, http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/"
