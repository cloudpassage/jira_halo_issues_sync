# Running in AWS Lambda

## Building the zip archive for AWS Lambda

Build the container image and run the lambda packaging script:

```
docker build -t jira_halo_issues_sync . && \
docker run \
    -v /tmp/JiraHaloIssuesSync/:/var/delivery/ \
    --entrypoint=/bin/sh  \
    jira_halo_issues_sync \
    /src/jira_halo_issues_sync/generate_lambda.sh
```

This will create the Lambda zip archive at
`/tmp/JiraHaloIssuesSync/JiraHaloIssuesSyncFunction.zip`

## Lambda configuration

* Runtime: Python2.7
* Handler: application.lambda_handler
* Memory: 256MB

### Encryption

Retrieval of KMS-encrypted environment variables (encryption in transit) is
supported for `HALO_API_KEY`, `HALO_API_SECRET_KEY`, `JIRA_API_USER`, and
`JIRA_API_TOKEN`. This tool expects encrypted environment variables for the
four aforementioned variables. However, if decryption fails, the actual values
of these fields will be used.

### Use of AWS SSM for managing timestamp between invocations

If AWS authentication information is present in environment variables
(`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) and the `AWS REGION` environment
variable is set, this tool will attempt to take a starting timestamp from SSM,
and will ignore the TIME_RANGE setting.
